# AngularJS Percent Directive Sample

## What does this do?

- Custom AngularJS 1.x directive
- Receives a model as a float (from 0 – 1)
- Displays to the user as a percentage (from 0 – 100)
- Would be marked invalid if below 0 or above 100

## Requirements for setup

- Git
- Node.js (but probably not an ancient version)
- npm

## Running the application

```
$ git clone {mine} {yours}
$ npm start
$ # Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser, or the link shown if not that
```

## Testing it

Tests run in your own browser via Karma test runner. There's plugins that can be used to make them auto launch, buuuuuuuut that's annoying when things just start popping up for you.

```
$ git clone {mine} {yours} # if you didn't already
$ npm test
$ # Open your browser to link shown - default is http://localhost:9876
```
