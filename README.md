# AngularJS Percent Directive Sample

## What does this do?

- Receives a model as a float (from 0 – 1)
- Displays to the user as a percentage (from 0 – 100)
- Would be marked invalid if below 0 or above 100

## Running the application

```
$ git clone {mine} {yours}
$ npm start
$ # Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```
